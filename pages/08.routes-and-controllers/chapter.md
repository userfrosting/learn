# Routes and Controllers

UserFrosting controllers are used to mediate interactions between the model and view, and are responsible for much of your application's logic.

This chapter explains RESTful design, the front controller pattern, creating new controllers and controller methods to implement the logic for your application, and how to properly handle input from the client.
