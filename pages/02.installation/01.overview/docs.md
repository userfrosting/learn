UserFrosting is a free, open-source jumping-off point for building user-centered web applications with PHP and Javascript.  It comes with a sleek, modern interface, basic user account features, and an administrative user management system - all fully functioning out of the box.

UserFrosting also has a not-so-secret ulterior motive: to get you to become a better developer.  The PHP community has evolved considerably over the past decade, beginning with PHP5's support for object-oriented programming in 2006, to the first meetings of [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/) to develop a [set of standards for PHP code](http://www.phptherightway.com/#code_style_guide), to the release of Composer as the _de facto_ package manager in 2012.  At the same time the web development community as a whole has been changing, with websites becoming more dependent on Javascript and CSS to provide sophisticated client-side features.

This breakneck pace has caused a lot of people to get left behind.  For someone who hasn't been doing web development continuously for the past ten years, it can feel like a hopeless task to try and get acquainted with all of the new tools and frameworks that seem to be coming out every day.  Relevant comic from [Abstruse Goose](http://abstrusegoose.com/503):

The problem is that when you're a busy developer with a lot of Real-Life (tm) projects to work on, it's very difficult to set aside time to read a book about technology X - especially when you're not even sure that you really _need_ to learn X!

UserFrosting has a better idea.  Instead of learning about these technologies as a purely academic exercise, you'll work on one of _your_ projects, and learn what you need as you go!

## What exactly will I learn?

There are three main categories that UserFrosting attempts to cover: software architecture, tools of the trade, and best practices.  Most of the PHP developers we see in chat or on Stack Overflow are behind in at least one these areas:

### Software architecture

- Object-oriented programming and SOLID
- The model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm
- Designing for maintainability and reuse
- Representational State Transfer (REST)
- Security

### Tools of the trade

- Frameworks
- Version control (Git)
- Package management (Composer)
- Templating engines (Twig)
- Data modeling and database abstraction (Eloquent)
- Logging
- Markdown

### Best practices

- Coding style and standards
- Development environments
- Debugging
- Test-driven development
- Going live
