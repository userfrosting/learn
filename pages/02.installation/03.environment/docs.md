The process of setting up UserFrosting so that you can begin work in your [local development environment](/basics/develop-locally-serve-globally) is known as **installation**.  This is a separate process from [deployment](/going-live/deployment), which is when you actually push your fully developed application to a live server.  Please be sure that you understand this distinction before proceeding further!  UserFrosting is not like, for example, Wordpress, where you can "install" directly to your production server.

The development environment you use goes with what you already knows about programing and what you used before. The questions below will guide you to the environment best suited for you.

- ["I don't have a local environment / don't know what that is"](/installation/environment/homestead)
- ["I have a local environment set up already"](/installation/environment/native)
- ["I'm already using Docker"](/installation/environment/docker)
