# Sprinkles

The **sprinkle** system is a modular, flexible approach to separating core functionality from developer-added code and content.

New in UserFrosting 4, this is a powerful means of customizing your site without having to modify UF's core code.  It also allows the UserFrosting community to share and integrate functionally cohesive units of code and content across projects.
