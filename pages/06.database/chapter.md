# The Database and ORM Layer

UserFrosting uses Laravel's [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent) component to provide a convenient abstraction layer on top of your database.  This allows you to quickly manipulate the database from within your controllers without needing to write tedious, repetitive queries each time.

We also discuss how to create database migrations, allowing you to easily set up your database tables and default values in various environments.
