UserFrosting uses jQuery and Bootstrap to provide a rich, intuitive, and modern user interface.

It also uses the following components by default (of course, you can replace any of these as you see fit in your own Sprinkles):

- [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) - [client-side templating engine](/client-side-code/client-side-templating)
- [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) - Wildly popular icon library
- [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) - More icons
- [Tablesorter](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/) - Flexible client-side table sorting
- [jQuery Validation Plugin](https://jqueryvalidation.org/) - client-side [validation](/routes-and-controllers/client-input/validation)
- [select2](http://select2.github.io/) - Dropdowns that support search, autocomplete, and more
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in JavaScript
- [URI.js](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/) - URL parsing library
- [SpeakingURL](https://pid.github.io/speakingurl/) - URL slug generation
- [iCheck](http://icheck.fronteed.com/) - Attractive checkboxes
- [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) - A modern approach to copy text to clipboard


This chapter fills in some of the gaps in communication between the client and server-side code bases, and explains how UserFrosting uses Handlebars.js and custom jQuery plugins to build dynamic, fully interactive features in your client's browser.
