When you start building your application with UserFrosting, you'll no doubt be adding your own tables to the data model.  After all, what's the point of having users if there's nothing in your application for them to use?

Though you could add new tables to your database through the command line, phpMyAdmin, or another tool, you will probably want something that is portable, allowing you to set up your database on other developers' machines and your test and production servers.  To do this, you should use a **migration**.

## Migrations

A migration is nothing more than a PHP script that uses Eloquent's [Schema](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/migrations) interface to create, remove, and modify tables in your database.  Migrations can also be used to perform additional setup tasks like seeding your tables with some default values, or prompting the developer for additional information in the command line.

### Semantic versioning

Every Sprinkle can optionally have a `migrations/` directory, which contains your migration scripts.  Each migration script should follow a **semantic versioning** naming scheme - for example, `/sprinkles/site/migrations/1.0.0-dev.php`.  The file name of your migration script represents the **database version** that it implements.  For example:

```bash
sprinkles/
└── site/
    └── migrations/
        ├── 1.0.0-dev.php
        ├── 1.0.0.php
        ├── 1.1.0.php
        └── 2.0.0.php
```

When you run the main UserFrosting install script (`migrations/install.php`), it will first check your `versions` table to see if any migrations have been run for each Sprinkle before:

| sprinkle | version     |
|----------|-------------|
| account  | 4.0.0-alpha |
| admin    | 4.0.0-alpha |
| site     | 1.0.0       |

If the Sprinkle has a record in this table, the install script will only run those migrations that have a version **greater than** the version in this record.  For example, in this case, the installer would only run the `1.1.0` and `2.0.0` migrations.

### Creating a migration

Your migrations themselves will contain PHP commands to create, modify, and drop tables.  For a simple example, suppose that you want to create an `owlers` table, which will be used to add application-specific fields for our users:

```php
<?php
    use Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager as Capsule;
    use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
    /**
     * Owler table
     */
    if (!$schema->hasTable('owlers')) {
        $schema->create('owlers', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->integer('user_id')->unsigned()->unique();
            $table->string('city', 255)->nullable();
            $table->timestamps();

            $table->engine = 'InnoDB';
            $table->collation = 'utf8_unicode_ci';
            $table->charset = 'utf8';
            $table->foreign('user_id')->references('id')->on('users');
            $table->index('user_id');
        });
        echo "Created table 'owlers'..." . PHP_EOL;
    } else {
        echo "Table 'owlers' already exists.  Skipping..." . PHP_EOL;
    }
```

`$schema` is a global variable created by the installer script, which models your database structure.  In this example, we call `hasTable` to check if the `owlers` table already exists, and then create it if it doesn't.  We then call a series of methods on the `$table` variable in `create`'s closure, to set up the columns and other table properties.

You'll also notice that we've created a `user_id` column, which associates each record in `owlers` with a corresponding record in `users`.  By adding a `unique` constraint to this column as well, we effectively set up a one-to-one relationship between `owlers` and `users`.

For a complete explanation of the available methods for working with tables, see Laravel's [Migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/migrations) chapter.

>>>> For your table to work correctly with Eloquent, it should always have an autoincrementing `id` column which serves as the primary key.  This is done automatically for you with the `increments` method.

### Running your migration

To run your migrations simply re-run `php install.php` from your command line, in UserFrosting's main `migrations/` directory.  If you want to do a "fresh install" of your migration, you will have to reverse any changes it made manually, and then change the version for the Sprinkle's migration in the `versions` table to a lower value.
