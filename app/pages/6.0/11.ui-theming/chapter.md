# UI Framework & Theming

Building a beautiful, functional user interface requires more than just reactive JavaScript—it needs a solid foundation of CSS components, thoughtful design patterns, and consistent styling. UserFrosting provides this foundation through **UIkit** and the **Pink-Cupcake** theme.

This chapter focuses on the visual and interactive layer of your application: how to use pre-built UI components, style your interfaces, work with forms and tables, and customize the theme to match your brand.

## UIkit: The Foundation

[UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) is a lightweight, modular CSS framework that powers UserFrosting's default interface. Unlike heavier frameworks, UIkit provides:

- **Lightweight**: Smaller bundle size means faster page loads
- **Modular**: Import only the components you need
- **Comprehensive**: Rich library of components from buttons to complex layouts
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works on all screen sizes
- **Customizable**: LESS-based theming with extensive variables

## Pink-Cupcake: UserFrosting's Theme

The **Pink-Cupcake** theme is UserFrosting's default theme, built on top of UIkit. It provides:

- Modern, professional styling out of the box
- Pre-built Vue components that integrate UIkit with reactive data
- Consistent design patterns across all pages
- Customizable variables for easy branding
- Accessible, user-friendly interfaces
