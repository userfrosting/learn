# Installation

Before you can build amazing web applications with UserFrosting, you need a development environment with the right tools. Setting this up might seem daunting if you're new to PHP development, but this chapter walks you through everything step by step.

We'll cover UserFrosting's system requirements (PHP, Composer, Node.js), show you how to set up your development environment (whether you prefer native installation or Docker), and use the Bakery CLI tool to create your first project.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a fully functional UserFrosting installation running on your local machine, ready for development. Whether you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux, we'll get you up and running.
