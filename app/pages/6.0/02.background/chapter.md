# Web Dev, the Right Way

UserFrosting has a not-so-secret ulterior motive: **to get you to become a better developer**. 

In this chapter, we'll talk about the state of modern web development tools and practices, and clear up some common misconceptions about how web applications actually work.  Then, we'll go over key security concepts. Finally, we'll discuss best practices to make sure that users will be able to find and use your application when it's finished.
