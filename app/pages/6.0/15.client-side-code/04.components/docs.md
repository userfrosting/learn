UserFrosting also comes with a number of [custom jQuery plugins](/client-side-code/components) that simplify the interactions between the client-side components and the backend. These can all be found in the `core` Sprinkle, under `assets/local/core/js/`.

### ufAlerts

Fetches and renders alerts from the [alert stream](/routes-and-controllers/alert-stream). See the section on [alerts](/client-side-code/components/alerts) for more information on using this plugin.

### ufCollection

A client-side widget that allows you to easily associate related entities in a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship by selecting them from a dropdown menu.

For example, both the "user roles" and "role permissions" interfaces use this plugin:

See the documentation on [collections](/client-side-code/components/collections) for more information on using this plugin.

### ufCopy

Helper to generate a tooltip alert for clipboard.js.

**Markup:**

```html
<div class="js-copy-container">
    <span class="js-copy-target">{{row.email}}</span>
    <button class="btn btn-xs js-copy-trigger"><i class="fa fa-copy"></i></button>
</div>
```

### ufForm

A convenient wrapper for AJAX form submission. Handles validation, loading icon during the submission process, and automatically fetching and displaying error messages after a failed submission.

See the section on [forms](/client-side-code/components/forms) for more information on using this plugin.

### ufModal

Renders and displays modal windows that dynamically fetch their content from a specified URL. Very useful for pop-up forms and dialog boxes.

```js
// Fetch and launch the modal
$('body').ufModal({
    // URL that serves the modal HTML
    sourceUrl: site.uri.public + '/modals/users/roles',
    // Additional request parameters
    ajaxParams: {
        user_name: userName
    },
    // Target element to display any errors generated by the modal request
    msgTarget: $('#alerts-page')
});

// Additional code to run after the modal has been retrieved and displayed.
// For example, setting up a form submission:
$('body').on('renderSuccess.ufModal', function (data) {
    var modal = $(this).ufModal('getModal');
    var form = modal.find('.js-form');

    ...
});
```

### ufTable

A wrapper for [Tablesorter](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/) that automatically fetches JSON data from a specified API endpoint, and dynamically builds paginated, sorted, filtered views on the fly. Very useful as a quick-and-easy way to get data from your database to the client.

See the section on [tables](/client-side-code/components/tables) for more information on using this plugin.
