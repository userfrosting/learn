# Internationalization

UserFrosting include a complete [internationalization](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/internationalization-I18N) system. This system allows you to translate your pages in any language you want. The internationalization service uses the [i18n module](https://github.com/userfrosting/framework/tree/main/packages/framework/src/I18n), which is part of the framework package, to handle translation tasks for UserFrosting and includes powerful pluralization handling based on Mozilla plural rules.
