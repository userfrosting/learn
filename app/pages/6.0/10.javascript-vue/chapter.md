# JavaScript & Vue

Modern web applications are fundamentally different from the static document-based websites of the past. Today's users expect rich, interactive experiences that respond instantly to their actions—without waiting for page reloads or server round-trips.

UserFrosting 6.0 embraces this reality with a modern JavaScript stack centered around **Vue 3** and **TypeScript**. This chapter teaches you how to build reactive, component-based applications that feel fast and responsive while integrating seamlessly with UserFrosting's backend.
