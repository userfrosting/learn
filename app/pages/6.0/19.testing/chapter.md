# Testing

Meet your most powerful, and sometimes overlooked allies: Unit and Integration tests! Gone are the days where you manually test your code. Let automated tests help you catch bugs before they reach production.

UserFrosting provides configuration for two comprehensive testing frameworks:

- **PHPUnit** for backend PHP code — test your models, controllers, services, and CLI commands
- **Vitest** for frontend code — test your Vue components, TypeScript modules, composables, and stores

This chapter covers everything you need to write, run, and maintain tests for your UserFrosting application.
