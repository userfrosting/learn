# Sprinkles

When building a web application, you face a fundamental challenge: **how do you extend and customize functionality without modifying the core codebase?** Directly editing framework code creates maintenance nightmares—every update risks breaking your changes, and sharing your work becomes nearly impossible.

UserFrosting solves this with **sprinkles**—a modular system that lets you extend and override default behavior without touching core code. Think of sprinkles like toppings on ice cream: the base (core framework) stays intact, while you add your own flavors on top.

This chapter explains how sprinkles work, how to create your own, and how to leverage community sprinkles to accelerate your development. You'll learn to build maintainable, modular applications that stay easy to update and share.
