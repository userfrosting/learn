# Advanced Features

As your UserFrosting application grows in complexity, you'll need to leverage more sophisticated features to build robust, maintainable applications. Beyond the basics of routes, controllers, and database models lies a rich ecosystem of services and patterns that give you fine-grained control over your application's behavior.

This chapter explores UserFrosting's advanced development features — the internal mechanisms and services that power the framework. You'll learn how to customize data models, tap into the application lifecycle, handle errors gracefully, manage sessions and caching, work with the filesystem, and extend UserFrosting's behavior through events and middleware.

These tools aren't just for edge cases — they're essential for building applications that are scalable, secure, and easy to maintain. Whether you're optimizing performance with caching, implementing custom business logic with events, or securing routes with middleware, these advanced features give you the flexibility to solve complex problems elegantly.
